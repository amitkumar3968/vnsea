/*!
 * @brief Subclass of UIScroller that modifies its behaviour.
 *
 * An instance of this class sits between the VNCView and the VNCContentView
 * that draws the screen content. Its job, aside from the obvious scrolling,
 * is to intercept finger events and either pass them to the EventFilter
 * or let the UIScroller superclass handle them. All single finger events
 * are passed to the superclass, while all chorded events are converted
 * to remote mouse events.
